# Tailwind UI Desgins

This repository contains different markups with tailwindCSS and AlpineJS. 

## TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables

## AlpineJS
Alpine is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.
